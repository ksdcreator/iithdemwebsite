    <br>
    <p id="Infocenter2">Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, with its fast-paced growth in quality research and teaching has emerged as one of the top 10 engineering institutes in India in the QS-2021 World Rankings. By prioritizing highly futuristic and novel areas like climate change and AI, IITH has the early moversâ€™ advantage of becoming a trendsetter in various other areas as well. We are also in an advantageous position of becoming a pedestal of interdisciplinary research and teaching by synergizing the strengths of our faculty in science, engineering, liberal arts and design. With the prime focus on entrepreneurship and management, I strongly believe that this department has great potential to nurture young entrepreneurs who can contribute to the economic and social development of the country.        ~ Prof. B. S. Murty</p>

    <h2 class="text-center">The Head's message</h2><br>
    <p id="Infocenter3">Traditionally the effectiveness of higher educational institutions is measured by the level of employability of the students it graduates. Currently we are moving away from this paradigm of producing employable students who are ready for the job market to creating entrepreneurs who are not only can become self-employed but also create employment for others. As a part of an institute which promotes innovation and interdisciplinary culture, our department has tremendous potential to become a pioneer in the area of entrepreneurial education and research. We welcome researchers, students and industry experts to partner with us in various roles like faculty, research scholars and advisors.  ~ Dr. M.P. Ganesh</p>
